# Cardano vision workshops reimbursement limits

All the amounts above are guidance which the product committee can decide to override with an explicit decision as long as overall the costs remain within the budget approved.&#x20;

The product committee will prioritise local product experts where possible or those who would be traveling regardless. The product experts approved by the product committee to travel will need to be mindful of keeping expenses to the minimum required.

Where possible the product committee should aim to run more than one workshop with the same product experts in the same region.

Below are the guide max amounts:

* Travel costs should be claimed to up to $2000 per product expert (this is the max amount of long flights. Economy is recommended where possible)
* Lodging costs and other expenses should be claimed to up to $1500
* Product expert could decide to ask for stipend for the workshop day of up to $500

For workshop organization

* $1500 for workshop venue rent
* $1000 for workshops food and refreshments
