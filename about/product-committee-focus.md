The Cardano Product Committee of Intersect aims to help connect the community by facilitating processes to create a shared vision and shared roadmap.

The committee's current focus is (in order):

<summary>Facilitate an open process to create a shared <a href="../committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/">2025 Cardano roadmap</a></summary>

As Cardano enters into decentralized governance, completing at the same time the original roadmap with the Age of Voltaire, the committee aims to help the community transition from a pre-defined roadmap to a commonly agreed one.\

The committee understands 2025 will be a 'bridge' year between the old and the new world, where continuity needs to be kept. Because of this, it is simplifying the roadmap creation process running it side by side with other committees such as budget committee.

<summary>Facilitate the creation of an open and transparent process to create a shared long-term 5-year vision for Cardano</summary>

One of the goals the Product committee is proposing for Cardano for 2025 is the creation of a new open and reusable process to create a shared long-term vision.

During the beginning of 2025, the committee aims to facilitate activities to create a shared process and then to facilitate the operationalization of the process itself to create the first open and shared Cardano vision which could inform also a 2026 Cardano roadmap.
