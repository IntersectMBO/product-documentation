# 2025 Cardano's roadmap

To achieve this, the Product Committee was formed in August 2024. With the support of an initial group of 3 voting seats and 20+ SMEs from the broader Cardano community, it brainstormed an **initial set of proposed draft goals**.

## Open Consultation

To **refine, expand, and adjust** these draft goals, the committee has since then been **collecting input and feedback** from focus groups (dApps builders, SPOs, Builders on Cardano, Builders on Cardano, and more), Intersect committees and Intersect working groups and the broader Cardano community.

For the latter, the committee has currently set different ways to contribute and participate to get as much consultation as possible:

* Regular open calls 👉🏻 [Register here](https://lu.ma/intersectProductCommittee)
* An open miro board 👉🏻 [Add feedback here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLbsV09Y=/)
* An open survey 👉🏻 [Participate here](https://forms.gle/9PJ6Fq3q9VhkgvJaA)
