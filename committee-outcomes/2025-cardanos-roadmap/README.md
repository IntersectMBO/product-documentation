# 2025 Cardano's roadmap

## 2025 Broad Cardano Goals

To achieve this, the Product Committee was formed in August 2024. With the support of an initial group of 3 voting seats and 20+ SMEs from the broader Cardano community, it brainstormed an **initial set of proposed draft goals**.

To **refine, expand, and adjust** these draft goals, the committee has since then been **collecting input and feedback** from focus groups (dApps builders, SPOs, Builders on Cardano, Builders on Cardano, and more), Intersect committees and Intersect working groups and the broader Cardano community.

The outcome of this process is [here](2025-proposed-cardano-goals.md). This was used by the Intersect committees to align their budget requests to a common direction.

## 2025 Cardano Roadmap

To provide a more detailed roadmap to Cardano in 2025, the Product Committee, with feedback from other committees and the broader community, has created a draft proposal that is currently open for consultation and that aligns with the 2025 Cardano budget.
