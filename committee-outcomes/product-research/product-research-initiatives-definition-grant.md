## Context

Part of the 2025 budget approved by Cardano DReps for Intersect Cardano Product Committee is focused on starting the first consolidated product research initiative in Cardano to inform the long term strategy and the yearly tactics.<br>

This project aims to deliver an initial simple process, a strategy to answer and expand the open questions,

and a set of structured research initiatives opportunities to be allocated with funding to product researchers in Cardano. These will deliver:

* Research initiatives based on the initial research questions outlined to be allocated via an open and transparent tender process
* A scalable and open framework to consolidate the Insights collected documenting them in a public repo for broader community consumption
* Key insights socialised and used to inform the 2030 Cardano strategy refinement and the yearly tactics proposal



This first grant will provide funds for the initial definition of scope for each research initiative, starting from the questions collected during the consultation held by the product committee ([here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#proposed-items-1)) and using the currently approved strategy framework.

## Requirements

The successful candidate, with proven context and knowledge about Cardano and Blockchain in general, and with proven expertise (aligned with the [acceptance criteria](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#high-level-skillset-and-expertise-required-1)), will be responsible for analysing the initial set of questions and the current strategy framework to refine the list of key initial questions to get data for and answer (adding, removing, adjusting and combining topics where needed). The purpose of this first refinement, which will require review by the Intersect Cardano Product Committee, is to then define up to 12 user and market research initiatives with detailed requirements, which will then become separate open grants, to support decision making about Cardano as a product.

### Milestone1:

* Review and analyse current set of [open questions](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#proposed-items-1) (adding, removing, adjusting and combining topics where needed)
* Review the current [Mission, Vision and strategy framework](https://gov.tools/governance_actions/3a5be93bafd26d0dbb9bfe19f4acecaa38cef75e50201d19199e6cc856db6601#0) to identify areas which might require user and market data for further clarity

### Milestone 2:

* Create a proposal for Intersect Product Committee for key topics and questions to research divided in proposed research initiatives (considering also other research efforts already defined)
* Once the proposal has been discussed and approved define detailed requirements for each approved initiative (up to 12) which will then become open grants&#x20;

## Application

This grant is open to everyone.

In their applications, applicants should describe:

* Their connection and knowledge about Cardano and blockchain
* Describe their expertise to deliver this grant
* Outline their approach to deliver the requirements
* What would be their aimed timeline to complete the work
