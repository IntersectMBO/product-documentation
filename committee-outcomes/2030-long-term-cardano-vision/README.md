# 2030 Long-Term Cardano Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
The consultation to create a 2030 community Cardano vision is open!&#x20;

üëâüèª Have your say by filling up [this survey](https://forms.gle/Zv1jcqdUCrKwFQxP6)&#x20;

üëâüèª Help us run one of the the vision creation workshops (guide [here](help-us-collect-insights/run-a-workshop.md))
{% endhint %}

## Why

The original Cardano roadmap, set by Cardano‚Äôs founders, ended with the age of Voltaire. Now it‚Äôs time to define an open, shared, and transparent process for the Cardano community to define a long-term vision and a roadmap.&#x20;

### Goal: Process for a shared community-driven vision

Our goals as a community in 2025 should be to create a shared long-term vision, so transitioning from the roadmap created by Cardano‚Äôs founders to a community-led dynamic vision and yearly roadmap. This will require a first version of the process.

The Cardano product committee of Intersect in 2025 aims to facilitate this process.&#x20;

### How it will support 2025, 2026 and onwards

#### 2024 for 2025

During 2024 Intersect facilitated the first process to get to a Cardano budget. Being the first year meant that many different processes had to be created from scratch and run in parallel. In particular, the different Intersect committees started to work with the community on a set of initiatives to be worked on in 2025 before a shared set of goals was agreed. Once the product committee had collected input and feedback from the community to collate the 2025 goals, we then aligned and connected the proposed scope to that.

#### 2025 for 2026 and onwards

Ideally, the initiatives to be proposed for the Cardano yearly roadmap should be based on a long-term Cardano vision which informs the broader direction of the roadmap itself, which then informs the Cardano budget.

In 2025 we aim to set this process and have the first outcome on time to inform a 2026 Cardano roadmap and a 2026 Cardano budget before the end of 2025.&#x20;

Then, in 2026, we aim to start even sooner, having already a set Cardano vision, which of course will need to be dynamically adjusted, we will be able to define together as a community the 2027 roadmap and budget and so on.

## Process

### Key steps

1. Collect broad input and insights \[view details]
2. Document learnings and create a draft proposal \[view details]
3. Critique and adjust the proposal \[view details]
4. Submit the refined proposal for community approval \[view details]

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Collect broad input and insights

Collect insights into where the community thinks we need to be by 2030 based on pain points and opportunities < this will give us foundational insights to generate a proposal and it will strengthen the process by fostering open participation

We will collect both broad, divergent insights and focused specific insights from targeted groups (for example builders in the community)&#x20;

#### How to collect and store insights

* **Workshops**
  * The product committee will facilitate directly at least one workshop per week (if feasible more)
  * The framework of the workshop will be provided to anyone who wants to facilitate a remote or in-person workshop \[framework here]
  * Insights from the workshops will be collected directly in the Miro boards and then documented in GitHub for official archive
* **Other events**
  * The committee aims to join existing events such as X spaces to collect insights. They will be documented on GitHub
  * The committee, and anyone willing to support, will join existing events (remote or in person) and either reserve a spot to run a workshop or use the questions defined to spark discussions
* **Survey**
  * The open questions defined will be shared also in an open survey, which will be closed at the end of the first series of workshops
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Document learnings and create a draft proposal

Consolidate and document all the insights collected to draft a first Cardano 2030 vision proposal based on the insights collected in the previous step,  data from user research and academic research, and any data from the market and SWOT analysis.

#### Draft proposal minimum structure

* Key objectives Cardano aims to have achieved by the year 2030 (at least)
  * For each objective provide context and rationale
* To keep continuity, increase engagement, and make it easier to communicate, divide the broad steps to achieve the objectives into Eras (aim perhaps for 2 or 3 considering the timeframe)
  * For each Era explain what broad key deliverables are expected, how they get us closer to the objectives, and the dependencies to previous or future eras
* References the insights used to inform the proposal itself (coming from community, users or customer interviews, from existing research, from the market and SWOT analysis, etc)

#### Where to store the proposal

The proposal's official version will be stored in GitHub\

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Critique and adjust the proposal

Collect feedback and critique for the first Cardano 2030 vision proposal by running the second series of workshops.

#### How to collect and store feedback

to gather feedback and critique on the proposal draft and define Eras (and their name)

* **Workshops**
  * The product committee will facilitate directly at least one workshop per week (if feasible more)
  * The framework of the workshop will be provided to anyone who wants to facilitate a remote or in-person workshop \[framework here]
  * Insights from the workshops will be collected directly in the Miro boards and then the workshop host will be documented in GitHub as a suggested PR to the draft Cardano 2030 vision
* **Other events**
  * Other events will be used to collect insights and sentiment about specific potential controversial topics
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Submit the refined proposal for community approval

Depending on the community sentiment and direction define the most appropriate way to ratify the first version of Cardano's long-term vision (a simple option would be an info action)
{% endstep %}
