# Run one of the Cardano 2030 Draft review

The Cardano product committee is aiming to run in-person workshops to collect feedback about the Cardano 2030 draft proposal ([here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision)). We have a budget allocated for each workshop to cover event costs and Product experts facilitation (including travel and accommodation if needed).
