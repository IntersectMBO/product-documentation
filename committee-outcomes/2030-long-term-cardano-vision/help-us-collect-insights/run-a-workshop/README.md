# Run one of the Cardano 2030 Draft review

The Cardano product committee is aiming to run in-person workshops to collect feedback about the Cardano 2030 draft proposal ([here](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision)). We have a budget allocated for each workshop to cover event costs and Product experts facilitation (including travel and accommodation if needed).

If you would like to run one:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Reach out to Product Committee

* Reach out to the Product committee via email [product-committee@intersectmbo.org](mailto:product-committee@intersectmbo.org)&#x20;
* on X ([https://x.com/IntersectCPC](https://x.com/IntersectCPC))
* directly to the secretary on the Intersect discord server (.lorenzobr1)
* Join the Tuesday Product committee session [here](https://luma.com/intersectProductCommittee)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Share details

* Where would you like to run it
* What has been your involvement with the process to meet facilitator criteria
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### After the event

If you got approved, after the event, you'll need to provide documented feedback of the draft version reviewed and if possible transcripts. If you also got approved for reimbursement of event costs, travel and accommodation, you will also be asked to send related receipts.&#x20;
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
