# Product expert hosting workshops - criteria

## Context

The Cardano Product Committee of Intersect has been allocated a budget to run workshops led by product experts to collect insights and feedback to define a proposal for Cardano by 2030.

The details of the proposal can be found [here](https://gov.tools/budget_discussion/481).

## Criteria

Following what is in the proposal and got approved, each workshop needs to be led by product experts. To be as efficient as possible with the funds allocated there is a preference to leverage existing events where the community is already present, and so it’s also preferable to have product experts who would be already attending the event or who are at least in the region.\
\
Because the workshops that need to be facilitated right now relate to the [existing proposed draft](https://product.cardano.intersectmbo.org/vision), the criteria to define a ‘product experts’ are connected to that:

* Anyone who has been actively participating in the drafting process and attends regularly product committee meetings (either as a voting seat, an SME or an observer)
* Anyone who has participated to at least one previous remote or in-person workshop and can show good understanding of the current proposed draft
* Overall, at least one of the two product experts, need to have good facilitation skills to guide the workshop, extract and document the feedback&#x20;

Where possible we’ll aim to distribute the facilitator role to different people following the criteria above.

Note: for fair use the funds allocated to the Product Committee, costs previously covered (ex. Travel and accommodation) by other budgets will not be double reimbursed.

Note: Any Cardano Community members (including any committee member) meeting above criteria can facilitate a workshop AND get reimbursed accordingly.

Note: to get reimbursed applicants will be asked to successfully complete a KYC/KYB process
