## Key Learnings

The feedback, primarily from community members, investors, and developers in Japan, highlights several consistent themes.

* Usability and User Experience: The biggest hurdle to mass adoption is the complexity and lack of user-friendliness. Respondents repeatedly called for a focus on making the network "simple," "easy," and "convenient" for everyone, not just a niche group of enthusiasts.
* Marketing and Education: The current messaging is seen as too technical and difficult for the average person to understand. Suggestions include hiring a well-known public figure as a spokesperson to promote the vision and creating simple, easy-to-understand videos to explain how Cardano works and how it can be used.
* Governance: While community-driven decision-making is valued, some respondents believe that excellent leadership is necessary for successful governance. There are also interesting suggestions for using AI as a "proposal supporter" to help correct human biases and for multi-layered decision-making.
* Real-World Application: The feedback suggests prioritizing partnerships and use cases in specific, high-impact sectors. The most commonly cited industries are public infrastructure and governance (e.g., voting systems, national ID, and tax management) and financial services (e.g., DeFi, stablecoins). There is a desire to see more concrete, real-world examples of adoption, moving beyond just memorandums of understanding (MOUs).
* Developer Ecosystem: One respondent specifically points out the need to strengthen the "developer support base" and maintain a sustainable incentive model to attract and retain developers.
