## Quotes

### 🌍 On the Future and the Need for Cardano:

> “The world will be chaotic and people will need new economic opportunities.”

> “Flying cars, $100 ADA, Charles and Elon opened the first base on Mars. In all seriousness, I see the world in a darker place. More divided, more disparity between the elite and lower classes. We can prepare by giving everyone the same financial tools.”

> “Based on the current trend of governments, I think bureaucracy, waste and fraud are going to be heavily targeted and decentralized open systems will be the solution for the world. This positions Cardano as the perfect solution to solve many problems, from transparent budgets to fair voting systems, let alone its primary use case of becoming the global economy.”

### 🛠️ On Technology Priorities:

> “Scalability Improvements (Layer 2, Hydra, Rollups), Cross-chain Interoperability, Enhanced Smart Contract Performance, AI & Automation Integration.”

> “Decentralized Identity & Privacy Solutions, On-Chain Governance Innovations — these are needed alongside scaling.”

***

### 📉 On Bottlenecks and Barriers:

> “Developer Experience & Onboarding, Market Awareness & Education, Scalability & User Experience.”

> “We need to get in front of governance and public infrastructure. We by all metrics should be the go-to solution for this by the end of the year.”

> “Being technology and not business driven.”

***

### 🤖 On AI and Automation:

> “I don't think AI should ever be used to replace a human action. It should primarily be a tool that can help us advance and organize at a much more rapid pace.”

> “From an administrative and time-saving point of view, it is key to furthering productivity.”

> “Nothing — other than on the edges of participating as a contributor to the community — but at the core AI should not be used in any way.”

***

### 🔐 On Security and Long-Term Resilience:

> “Continue to adopt new tech in a prudent and deliberate way. Ensure the attack vector is within acceptable limits and increase the bulletproof-style tech we currently have.”

> “Continue to fund ecosystem growth as well as development.”

***

### 💬 On Final Thoughts:

> “There is a lot of work to do. We better start now.”
