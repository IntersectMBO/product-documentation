## Agenda

* Review actions from the previous meeting
  * update on budget socialization process
  * approve change to budget for vision creation
  * approve name change inside academic research to foundational research and foundational innovation
* 2030 vision process
* Topic: Strengthening Contributor Retention & Security in Cardano - from Juan Sierra ([presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CB_okE7MIc5Sz5i8eO2wp3_xP-ULbqQ8SYefyHTsBjo/edit?usp=sharing))

## Updates

* The voting seats approved to reduce the vision creation sub-bucket from $200k to $75k, allocating $50k towards retroactive reimbursement of anyone that wants to run an in-person local workshop (if the budget gets approved) and $25k to support the overall facilitation of the process, including committee members supporting local dedicated workshops. This is also to have a stronger focus on in-person workshops to collect regional insights, both about broader Cardano evolution depending on the regional perspective and about regional use cases and opportunities for Cardano.
* The voting seats approve changing the names of the Academic research sub-bucket categories from 'Academic research' and 'Academic innovation' to 'Foundational research' and 'Foundational innovation', to reduce name duplication.
