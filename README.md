## What is the Roadmap Committee?

We originally designed a Vision committee for [Intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) as our 7th committee with the remit to manage visionary scope and roadmap for future development items.&#x20;

We now see that we need a committee to manage a variety of different types of Cardano development scope and establish a roadmap. In this way, Vision could then become a category of the scope where other categories of scope can be Continuity (maintenance, upgrades, and core development), features, or research. The scope may also include categories such as marketing, promotion, or other non-technical categories.

Vision, strategy, and roadmap are all elements of a product function, because of this in its first meeting the committee updated its name from Roadmap Committee (originally Vision Committee) to Product Committee.
