# Roadmap committee (proposed)

## What is the Roadmap Committee?

We originally designed a Vision committee for [Intersect](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/) as our 7th committee with the remit to manage visionary scope and roadmap for future development items.

We now see that we need a committee to manage a variety of different types of Cardano development scope and establish a roadmap. In this way, Vision could then become a category of the scope where other categories of scope can be Continuity (maintenance, upgrades, and core development), features, or research. The scope may also include categories such as marketing, promotion, or other non-technical categories.

This naturally led us to consider that the artifact we need is a backlog to define scope and we need a backlog process to generate a pipeline for how the scope is community-reviewed and approved. Each item on the backlog will be approved with an expectation of a schedule, which will give us a **roadmap**. Hence, why we’re now considering that our 7th committee should be a **Roadmap committee** rather than the original Vision committee.&#x20;

A working group is formed to generate the definitions of scope items, scope categories in a shared Cardano backlog and to design the process to have the scope items reviewed and ultimately approved for funding.

The proposed Roadmap committee will provide the approved list of items on the shared backlog to a Budget committee. The Budget committee’s remit is to calculate an appropriate budget to assign to backlog scope items and manage a process to have a budget approved by the community to be paid out of the Treasury.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All of the above is a draft in design with many questions to be answered. Intersect acting in the role of servant-leader is facilitating and coordinating the Core Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group to figure out these answers.
{% endhint %}

The Core Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group may decide to change its name befitting its purpose. Whatever name is decided upon on a working group level will also change the name at the committee level. As the working group matures we do expect it to be promoted to become a committee-level group due to its importance.
