The Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group's mission is to foster a transparent, inclusive, and adaptable core infrastructure roadmap for the decentralized development of Cardano as an open-source blockchain and maintain its competitiveness.

To fulfill this mission, the working group has set several goals that needs to be looked into, namely Vocabulary & Definitions, Communication Plan, The Process, and Vision.

As this is an iterative process, the schedule below will be subject to change according to the evolving needs of the working group.

These milestones provide a structured framework for the group to follow, ensuring that efforts are coordinated and focused on achieving the set goals. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure that the group remains on track and can adapt to any emerging challenges or opportunities.

## Outline Meeting Schedule

To assure success and velocity of the working group, a simple ethos has been devised. Every session starts and ends with a defined outcome that contributes to the overall process. For example, one outcome of the first session would be to take one item to the working group, e.g. log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree), and challenge if the item is defined enough to be considered, compared and sorted.
