The Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group's mission is to foster a transparent, inclusive, and adaptable core infrastructure roadmap for the decentralized development of Cardano as an open-source blockchain and maintain its competitiveness.

To fulfill this mission, the working group has set several goals that needs to be looked into, namely Vocabulary & Definitions, Communication Plan, The Process, and Vision.

As this is an iterative process, the schedule below will be subject to change according to the evolving needs of the working group. &#x20;

## Outline Meeting Schedule

To assure success and velocity of the working group, a simple ethos has been devised. Every session starts and ends with a defined outcome that contributes to the overall process. For example, one outcome of the first session would be to take one item to the working group, e.g. log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree), and challenge if the item is defined enough to be considered, compared and sorted.&#x20;
