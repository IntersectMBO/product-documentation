# How to Participate in Shaping the Technical Roadmap

Your input is crucial in determining the direction of Cardano's development for 2025 and beyond. By participating, you help prioritize what’s most important and ensure that we are addressing the needs of the Cardano community. Here’s how you can get involved and contribute effectively to the roadmap.

***

### **Step 1: Understand the Product Goals**

Our product goals are the foundation for shaping future projects. We recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with these goals.\

### **Step 2: Learn About the Core Infrastructure Roadmap (CIR) Process**

The CIR process is your pathway for submitting new project proposals. Our team will review and triage all submissions, passing them to the relevant committees for evaluation.\

### **Step 3: Submit Your Proposal**

Ready to suggest a new project or initiative? Complete the submission form to propose your idea. Your submission will be triaged by the CIR Working Group and evaluated by the relevant committee, such as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).\
👉 **Complete the submission form** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD6vCGq1oQ3eSa3tOKN1DB3MJaMxs96zXqKp8v1ghHw6tceQ/viewform?vc=0\&c=0\&w=1\&flr=0)\

Ensure your proposal clearly outlines your idea, its relevance to one or more Product goals, and any necessary technical details. Full instructions are included in the form to help guide you through the process.

### **Step 4: Track Your Proposal’s Progress**

Once your proposal is submitted and reviewed, it will be available for the community to follow. You can track its progress via the **Proposal Cards** page, where all reviewed proposals are listed as proposal cards.\

### **Step 5: Engage in Discussions**

Join the ongoing conversations around these projects and goals. We hold regular Q\&A sessions where you can voice your thoughts, ask questions, and provide feedback on specific proposals.\
