# Current State

During Q4 2023, the Intersect team constructed the “Cardano Continuity” programme. ‘Continuity’ was first coined in 2023 to express the technical work required to keep the Cardano Blockchain infrastructure running, including upgrades and necessary developments. Intersect documented the highest product priorities and drafted a framework to evaluate their priority to drive the growth of the Cardano economy. Since Q1 of 2024, Intersect issued continuity contracts to 8 suppliers to continue development and bring exciting new features to our community.&#x20;

This resulted in the 9 items for a Cardano Backlog which were evaluated by one or more of the economic variables and technical goals which underpin the Cardano economy.&#x20;

The 3 economic variables are:&#x20;

* Competition (driven by increasing utility); more businesses competing for resources
* Risk Management; insurance or other forms that encourage investment
* Regulation; provides confidence to end users to trade in the economy&#x20;

To improve on the economic variables above, the items will tie into 1 or more of the technical goals below:&#x20;

1. Participation; growing global participation drives transaction growth
2. Collective Governance; decentralization means all participants manage the economy
3. Performance; speed, memory and throughput all contribute to transaction growth
4. Interoperability; widening the economy to join with other economies increases transaction growth
5. Transparency & Auditability; builds confidence to trade in the economy

For future information regarding the 9 items, please refer to the quarterly reports here: [https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-continuity/cardano-continuity-reports/quarterly-reports](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano/cardano-continuity/cardano-continuity-reports/quarterly-reports)

While Continuity items are necessary to keep the Cardano blockchain infrastructure running, the Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group recognizes the need to develop a process to include a wider representation of community endorsed items and categories that benefits the community and the Cardano ecosystem, such as Proof of Concept (POC) or research based categories for items that has unquantifiable benefits or needs further challenge to prove value.\
