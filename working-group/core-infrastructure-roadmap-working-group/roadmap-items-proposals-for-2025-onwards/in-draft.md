## OBL-1. Ouroboros Leios

Ouroboros Leios is a novel protocol extending Ouroboros Praos that aims at dramatically increasing the throughput of Cardano network. Leios is based on the key idea of input endorsers. Whereas in a classical blockchain, the blocks' body directly contains transactions, in Leios the blocks' body can also contain references to Endorser blocks which themselves contain references to so-called Input blocks containing the actual transactions. Those references are certified through a voting mechanism that guarantees a majority of validators agree on the content of Endorser blocks. By decoupling the logic of validating blocks' payload and extending the blockchain, and limiting the work needed to verify the chain, much higher throughput can be achieved and new use cases can be unlocked.

Simulating Leios is a critical precursor to subsequently implementing it because Leios aims to make full use of network bandwidth in a heterogeneous environment where input blocks, endorser blocks, votes, certificates are diffused in addition to the ordinary Ouroboros Praos traffic. Simulation will provide detailed statistics on Leios performance under normal conditions, during congestion, and in the face of adversarial activity. Formal methods are required to verify that the network simulations are faithful to the Leios protocol.

## OBP-1. Ouroboros Peras

Ouroboros Peras modifies the chain-selection rule to include the "boosting" of the dominant chain's blocks by a quorum of votes from periodic randomly-selected voting committees. It reduces the settlement time by orders of magnitude without weakening the existing security guarantees. It is compatible with and orthogonal to Leios and Genesis, and it only has a very minor impact on the resource consumption of block-producing nodes. It requires modification of the chain-selection rule, a small change the the CDDL of the block body, and the creation, transport, and verification of votes and the certificates that witness a quorum of votes. It adds several new protocol parameters.

Peras has synergies with Leios and other proposals that involve voting, certificates, or transport/storage of additional data beyond what Praos and Genesis already handle. The Peras task involves (a) implementing this protocol in the Haskell-based Cardano node, (b) providing node-oriented conformance tests (which are distinct from the already existing protocol-level conformance tests) so that non-Haskell nodes (in Rust, Go, etc.) can be verified, and (c) updating the relevant node documentation and specifications.

One of the key benefits is Peras will dramatically shorten the "settlement" or "finality" time for transactions, providing near-certainty within a couple of minutes regarding whether a block will forever remain on the main chain.

## BAB-1. Marketplace application for Babel fees

For the purpose of allowing atomic swaps, DApp fee sponsorship, fee coverage, etc., a proposal is raised for ledger changes that (1) add new fields to Tx which allow a top-level tx to contain sub-txs (2) allow individual sub-txs to be unbalanced, and not provide their own collateral inputs or witnesses, but the full batch (top level+sub-txs) must be fully valid, i.e. is balanced, has collateral, etc. (3) showcase how this approach can be extended to other types of intent processing

There are multiple key benefits to this implementation, including (1) transactions can be unbalanced, which allows for performing implicit trades within batches (including covering each others' collateral, fees, minUTxO) (2) scripts can inspect other transactions in the same batch (3) allows deduplication of script and datum data across multiple transactions in one batch and (4) possibility of extension to other intents
