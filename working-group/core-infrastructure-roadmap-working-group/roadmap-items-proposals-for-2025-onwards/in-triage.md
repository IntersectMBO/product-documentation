## LSM-2. Increase Capability to store UTxOs on disk using LSM (Integration to Node)

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a follow-up work from current inflight item [LSM-1](../current-state/list-of-inflight-items.md#id-2.-increase-capability-to-store-utxos-on-disk-using-lsm-pre-contracted)
{% endhint %}

With continued growth of the Cardano Blockchain Ledger, the need to move from an in-memory to a disk persisted solution is even more important. This achieves more scalability and assures SPOs and full node wallets of being able to operate on commodity hardware or retain a lower footprint on cloud . Implementation of LSM will use an innovative approach to persisting to disk (SSD) using a Log Structured Merge(LSM) tree, which will be built standalone and integrated in node.

The component will take the form of a Haskell library for managing tables of key-value data stored persistently on disk. This is to reduce the memory size of the UTXO set (ledger) that will allow us to potentially quadruple the transactions on the network without increasing memory cost, which is hugely beneficial to Stake Pool Operators. This is intended to be used later within the Cardano node for storing large parts of the ledger state on disk. The component is specified as a “stand alone” component, in isolation from Cardano, with detailed functional and non-functional requirements. The work is structured in such a way that after an initial design phase further ratification and community feedback will be sought prior to any implementation or production deployment.
