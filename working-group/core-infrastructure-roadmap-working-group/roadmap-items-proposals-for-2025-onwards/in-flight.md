Items on the in-flight list contains ready-to-implement items. \
Items here will be initiated subject to budget and suitable delivery capability being available. \
Research has been completed to allow progression to discovery or development. \
Status-wise, some items in this category are already progressing and have been socialised by CIR-WG to community. \
Value-wise, items in this category align to the 3 pillars of Decentralisation, Ecosystem and Scalability.\
Whilst ready-to-implement, it is possible that some items on this list may be re-assessed to align with the evolving product direction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
