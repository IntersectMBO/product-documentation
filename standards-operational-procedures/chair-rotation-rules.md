# Chair Rotation rules

* The Chair serves a 12-month term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. There are no term limits for the Vice-Chair role.
* At the end of the Chair’s term, voting members will elect both a Chair and Vice-Chair. The candidate receiving the most votes becomes Chair; the runner-up becomes Vice-Chair.
* It is generally recommended to re-elect the current Chair if they have performed well. If the Chair has already completed two consecutive terms, it is recommended that the Vice-Chair be considered for the Chair position.
* If the elected Chair does not meet the committee’s requirements, the following actions may be taken:
  * A vote of no confidence may be called.
  * The Chair may voluntarily step down, preferably with a three-month notice period.
